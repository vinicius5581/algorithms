/**
Generate random max index 
Given an array of integers, randomly return an index of the maximum value seen by far. 

e.g.:
Given [11,30,2,30,30,30,6,2,62, 62] 
Having iterated up to the at element index 5 (where the last 30 is), randomly give an index among [1, 3, 4, 5] which are indices of 30 - the max value by far. Each index should have a Â¼ chance to get picked. 
Having iterated through the entire array, randomly give an index between 8 and 9 which are indices of the max value 62.
